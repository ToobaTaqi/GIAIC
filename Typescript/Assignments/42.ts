// reat Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    let greatMagicians: string[] = [];
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        greatMagicians.push(`the Great ${magician}`);
    }
    return greatMagicians;
}

let magicianNames: string[] = ["Donkey", "Horse", "Bangali baji"];

let greatMagicianNames: string[] = make_great(magicianNames);

show_magicians(greatMagicianNames);
